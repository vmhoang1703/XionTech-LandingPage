# AI log entry: UX first draft

## 2026-09-28 — Website UX first draft (products + outsourcing, multi-page)

- **Who / tool:** Amber Do / Claude Code (Claude Opus 5.5) with BMad `bmad-agent-ux-designer`, `bmad-ux`, `design-taste-frontend`
- **Prompt (short):** "Build my company website (xiontechs) using white, navy and amber … showcase our web
  app and phone app in a creative way … structure similar to nashtechglobal.com", then many review rounds.
- **What the AI did:** Ran UX discovery, sampled the brand colours from the logo (navy `#163663`, amber `#FFC000`),
  built colour themes, three concept mini-sites, landing pages v1 and v2, a type kit, and finally a 7-page static
  prototype. Read the current xiontechs.com pages to reuse facts (services, 4-D process, industries, stats).
- **Decision / result:** Multi-page site with Products and Outsourcing both near the top of Home; brand colour
  rhythm per section instead of dark mode; core values in the office-banner wording; offices limited to
  Ho Chi Minh City and Dallas; email capture on every page; unverified content marked `[Placeholder]`.
- **AI got it wrong?** Yes, several times:
  - The first colour themes and concepts were rejected as "too AI, too simple". Solid swatches did not show
    what the site would feel like.
  - The AI verified pages by driving a browser preview, which looked like glitching on the user's screen. The user
    asked it to stop, so later checks were static only (syntax, links, anchors).
  - The first landing headline wrapped to 4 lines at desktop width; caught by measuring, then shortened.
  - The current site lists Da Nang and a second HCMC address; the team confirmed only HCMC and Dallas.
  - The current About page shows leadership names that look like theme placeholders ("Mary Crispy",
    "Rayan Athels"). They were not reused.
  - A scripted edit while adding `[Placeholder]` markers broke the news data in `site.js`; caught by
    `node --check`, restored and redone.
